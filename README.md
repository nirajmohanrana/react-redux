# **REDUX TOOLKIT PRACTICE**

## Redux

Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments, and are easy to test.
<br>
While it's mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library.

## Redux Toolkit

Redux toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
<br>
Redux is Great, but it does have a few shortcomings.
<br>

- Configuring redux in an app is complicated.
- A lot of other packages have to be installed to get redux to do something useful
- It requires too much boilerplate code.

Redux toolkit serves as an abstraction over redux. it hides the difficult parts ensuring you have a good developer experience.
